# Get_my_Location
A Location Getter App to send your place to your friends or get their places.This application (with maps) Provide the best route between you and your friend/s.
It can also be used to send emergency notifications if someone needs help, with some features that will help to elaborate more about the emergency case (provided that these features are added in the furure)

-Firebase (Firestore , Storage , Authentication)

-Dependency Injection (dagger-hilt)

-third party library (Glide)
